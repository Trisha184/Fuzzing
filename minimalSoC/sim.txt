The design hasn't changed and need not be recompiled. 
If you really want to, delete file /nelms/UFAD/tambiaratabassum/SoC-Fuzzing/simv.daidir/.vcs.timestamp and
run VCS again.

./simv
Info: [VCS_SAVE_RESTORE_INFO] ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) is detected on the machine. To enable $save functionality, ASLR will be switched off and simv re-executed.
Please use '-no_save' simv switch to avoid re-execution or '-suppress=ASLR_DETECTED_INFO' to suppress this message.
